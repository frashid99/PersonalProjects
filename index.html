	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p class="p">I am currently a Senior at UC Santa Cruz pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science hoping to graduate by 2020. The many Compter Science classes I have taken through my time in Santa Cruz have helped me solidify my interest in the CS field leading me to create this awesome website!</p>
	<p class="p">During my Freshman and Sophomore years of college I took many Java classes that were meant to solidify my understanding of Java and Data Structures. I was having trouble keeping up with a lot of the programming assignments for my Data Structures class which is when I decided to seek help from a close friend of mine who is an excellent programmer. Every week I would sit down with him and he would walk me through on how to approach my assignment. He taught me many neat tips and tricks, the most helpful being to use Sublime Text Editor instead of an IDE. By using Sublime I was able to familiarize myself better with Java syntax and catching errors instead of having an IDE do things for me.</p> 
	<h2>Finding My Passion</h2>
	<p class="p">Throughout these classes I still wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to do in the CS field once I graduated college. It wasn't until my Junior year that I found what I wanted to specialize in. I took a Mobile Development class where we were to make an android app as a group. For my group, we decided to make a study group app and I was to handle the front-end part. Once I began working on the app's UI/UX, I knew this is what I wanted to do as my career. To me, front-end development was like a form of art where I didn't need to know how to draw (I suck at drawing lol). I also enjoyed front-end because of the fact that it is more visual compared to back-end development so that I could see the immediate changes I was making. I had full control over the appearance of the app and it gave me immense pleasure by having an image in my head come alive, much like a drawing.</p>

	<h1>Industry</h1>
	<p class="p">My first experience with using my Computer Science knowledge in a work setting was as a Math/Computer Science tutor at OneClass EasyKe.</p>
	<p class="p">I decided to tutor Math along with Computer Science since my Math skills were very weak and I learned from others that teaching is one of the best ways to learn. Using that knowledge, I was able to further strenghten my Math and Computer Science skills by tackling the students' homework/projects from the mindset of "How would I teach this to myself in a way I would understand?"</p>
	<p class="p">The students I tutored were mainly international Chinese students, many of whom had trouble with English also. So not only was I able to help with Computer Science projects, I would also help out with their English when needed. I really enjoyed tutoring students on EasyKe because each students presented a new challenge from the difficulty of their assignment to the way each one of them learned.</p>
	<p class="p">Currently I am interning at Open Learning Exchange where I am tasked with helping out with the Android application development. Throughout my internship here I was given the oppurtunity to work remotely with two weekly meetings. Working for this company is an amazing oppurtunity for me where I get to do something meaninful. Our main goal is to deliver a education software where children in impoverished, violence-riven, and disrupted parts of the world are still able to learn from donated Android tablets. Aside from that my favorite part about working here, much like EasyKe, was getting to work with international students. At our weekly meetings </p>
